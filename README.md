Lightfooted adds an enchantment that allows you to walk without triggering effects such as slime bouncing, falling through powder snow, activating sculk sensors, lighting up redstone ore, and being damaged by magma blocks.
It also prevents Frost Walker ice from interrupting flowing water, which can disrupt all sorts of Vanilla mechanisms and item transfer systems.
